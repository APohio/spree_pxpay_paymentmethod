This is a gem for Spree > 0.70 which adds PXPay (paymentexpress.com - a NZ and Australian Payment Processor) as a Payment Method.

This is does not use Active Merchant - this is not the version of the gateway with a POST API (see ActiveMerchant PXPost docs), PXPay is the service hosted on the Payment Express servers and credit card information is never touched by your Spree implementation (sort of like PayPal's Website Payments system).

This is one of my first Spree Gems, with tests yet to do. Please excuse glaring mistakes. Written to suit a client's needs.

Inspired by the spree-hosted-gateway gem (https://github.com/joshmcarthur/spree-hosted-gateway), which I couldn't get to work (possibly because it's written for Spree 0.30) and the work done by @bradleypriest who wrote the PXPay gem (https://github.com/bradleypriest/pxpay)

TO DO:

The DPS documentation talks of being able to embed as an iframe. I'd like to see if it is possible within Spree's checkout process somewhere. Have to look into the states within the state machine, I imagine.
